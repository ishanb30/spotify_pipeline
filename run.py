"""
run.py - orchestrates each pipeline run

Assumptions:
    1. The table PIPELINE_RUNS exists to be written to

Known Limitations:
    1. If the UPDATE query in the main except block in run_pipeline fails,
       then RUN_STATUS will not be updated to FAILED in PIPELINE_RUNS.
       Therefore, it is possible that a failed pipeline run could have a
       RUN_STATUS of STARTED. However, the failure is caught and logged to
       pipeline.log
